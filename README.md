# Gesture Detection Using MATLAB

Gesture detection is a process in which gestures or postures of human body parts are identified and are used in human computer interaction for various purposes. In this project we aim to use hand gesture detection to classify numbers and convert textual output to speech.

## Usage

Install [MATLAB](https://in.mathworks.com/help/install/install-products.html) on your system and run the GestureDetector app. Make sure that the nueral network and other files are also downloaded on the same folder. 

## Simulation

You can find the Project report and simulation [HERE]().
